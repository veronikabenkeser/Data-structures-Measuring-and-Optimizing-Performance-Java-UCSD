###Course 2 out of 5 in Java Programming: Object-Oriented Design of Data Structures from University of California, San Diego
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented

##About this Course

In this course, you will use and analyze data structures that are used in industry-level applications, such as linked lists, trees, and hashtables.  You will explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible.  You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval, addition of new data, deletion of elements, and/or memory usage.
The program you will build throughout this course allows its user to manage, manipulate and reason about large sets of textual data.
